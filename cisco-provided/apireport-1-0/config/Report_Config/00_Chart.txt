#
#   previous_day   = yesterday (starting 00:00)
#   previous_month = entire month before current month

#
# datestamp_to & datestamp_from are IGNORED
# for all except 'custom' report spans.
#
# The date must be in this format:
#
# "DD Mon YYYY HH24:MM:SS"
#
# (spaces must be replaced with "%20")
#
#  Example datestamps:
#
#    datestamp_from=2%20Dec%202006%2000:00:00
#    datestamp_to=11%20Dec%202006%2023:59:59
#

#datestamp_from=
#datestamp_to=

#
#  rollup sets the rollup time period
#
#  a value of "0" creates a single
#  time period (necessary for pie charts)
#
#  a value of 86400 divides everyting by
#  day, applying the GMT offset from the
#  main config file before displaying
#  the data
#
#  etc.
# 
ROLLUP=0

#
# don't change these unless you're familiar with the 5.0 API!
