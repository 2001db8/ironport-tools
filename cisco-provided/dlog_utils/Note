Delivery Log Parsing Tool Suite Release Notes

Version 1.4 

Document Revision 1 (February 12, 2004)

The IronPort Systems Delivery Log Parsing Tool Suite provides a series of i
programs for processing the binary delivery log files produced by the 
Ironport Messaging Gateway(tm) appliance. The various parsing tools convert 
Delivery Logs from binary format into XML (Extensible Markup Language),  CSV 
(comma separated values) or ASCII text file formats. Conversion tools are 
provided in Perl, C and Python. 

This release of the delivery log parsing tools provides the following new 
features:

1) Support for the delivery logs generated from AsyncOS version 3.7.

   IronPort Delivery Logs were updated in AsyncOS version 3.7
   to include the following data:

   * The IP address of the host of the incoming message. 
   * The SMTP response code and message from recipient host. 

2) Modification of the following output:

   * In the dlog_xml C program and the dlog_xml.pl perl script, 
     the values for injection time (inj_tim) and devliery time 
     (del_time) were previously reported incorrectly. The value
     for delivery time was being displayed as the injection time, 
     and vice versa. This issue has been corrected in this release
     of the tools.

   * In the dlog_csv.pl perl script, the columns for injection time and 
     delivery time have been switched to coincide with the column 
     placement in the dlog_csv C program.

   * Minor modifications of the output of the dlog_ascii.pl perl 
     script to conform with the dlog_ascii C program.
     
   Note: a -B flag has been provided to allow the parsing tools to output
   results consistent with previous versions. 

3) A -version command has been added to display which version of 
   delivery log parsing tool is being used.
