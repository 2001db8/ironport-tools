Usages
 The most up-to-date flags should always be available via the -help flag given to the program.
 Common usages:
   #basic:
   ./spamtowho.pl -f mail.current
   #basic, but begin collecting from time indicated
   ./spamtowho.pl -f mail.current -t1 'Fri Jan 28 00:00:00 2004'
   #basic, but stop collecting at time indicated
   ./spamtowho.pl -f mail.current -t2 'Fri Feb  8 00:00:00 2004'
   #use indicated file as well as any in indicated directory, trace messages
   # which match 'yahoo' in the mail-from
   ./spamtowho.pl -f mail.current -directory mail_logs -tracemailfrom yahoo
   #See the -help output for more explanation on available flags
   ./spamtowho.pl -d ../maildirectory -recurse -f mail.current.01.c -f mail.current.02.s -recurse -per_domain -collate-domain -collate-ip -hourly -msg-csv -htmlout longoutput.html > longoutput.txt

To generate HTML format output you must use the -htmlout flag as shown in
the examples above.
In order for the HTML viewed to generate the JavaScript graphs, the
referenced .js files must all be in the same directory as the viewed HTML.
These JavaScript files are: diagram.js diagram_dom.js diagram_nav.js from
http://www.lutanho.net/diagram/ version 3.3. (3.31 originally)

Sending the program the ALRM signal causes it to output all information
processed up to the current position, and continue. (see "man kill" on
*nix systems)

Inaccuracies
1. Message counts may actually differ from the actual number of messages
   injected onto the system, due to filter BCCing and the like.  In such
   occurances the program attempts to increment any related scores such as
   SBRS relevances, and others.
2. For Messages generated on-system, determining the size of the message is
   sometimes not possible.  Part of postprocessing attempts to backfill
   these values with computed averages from the rest of the dataset.
3. With use of -timings (extremely expensive option which does not work on
   Windows) if a system has NTP time changes time calculations will default
   to 0 if a result is calculated as negative.
4. Occasionally calculated percentages in a table may not add up to 100% due
   to rounding.

Recommendations and Observations
1. Do not execute the program on a slow system, or a system with limited RAM.
2. Execution on over 1GB of logfiles may be VERY slow with certain expensive
   flags which collate extensive per-ip, per-user, or per-domain statistics.
   Completion of the run may not be possible.  Some operating systems will
   kill such a process.
3. Log files with consistent workqueue backup characteristics incur slower
   processing due to the program's complete in-memory message object.
4. Some displayed statistics sections may duplicate data found in other
   sections.
   e.g. some information displayed in 'Aborts' may be found in the 'Filter
   Actions' section.
5. This program will not work with the IronPort M-series appliance.
6. Systems which indicate messages being delivered to an End User Quarantine
   (EUQ): some statistical information will be shown about how many messages
   were referred to the quarantine, and if the quarantine is *local* some
   information may be gathered about how many were released.  However for
   deleted messages, nothing is known - the message disappears inside of the
   EUQ; the fact of the deletion is shown in the euq_logs log but is not shown
   in the MGA mail logs.
7. Pie chart of "Overall system catch-rate" - if the -HATmultiplier' flag is
   given with a 0 value, the HAT and Rejectable numbers are extrapolated via
   a product of the number of connections on relevant SenderGroup policies and
   the program's runtime-derived number of recipients per successful connection.
   By default this will map 1 rejected connection to a likely 1 rejected
   message.
   If connections are identified in a sendergroup named 'Blacklist' but were
   not actually rejected, then these accumulate to the 'Rejectable' counter.
8. Interim verdicts
   In order to collate interim verdicts and statistics, the -interim flag must
   be given.
   If an interim verdict line is seen like this:
      McAfee negative Sophos negative McAfee negative Sophos positive	   1
   What this means is that the message was quarantined after going through the
   AV engines the first time, and then released to go through the engines a
   second time.  Results may be different the 2nd time around, as shown.


Messages
1. "Unhandled entry" - messages which appear with this text indicate entries in
   the mail log which are not recognized by the Program.  This may be due to a
   version change unrecognized in the current version of the Program, or it may
   be due to strange formatting of input originally given to the MGA.

2. Just as an example and for debugging reference, here is a sample of the data-
   structure built for every message.  -debug exposes this at times.
Data Structure format sample:
$VAR1 = {
          'starttimestamp' => 'Tue May  8 11:00:21 2007',
          'interface' => 'Management',
          'finalized_rcpts' => 1,
          'remoteip' => '10.1.1.140',
          'Delivery status' => 'was rewritten',
          'AS-negative' => 1,
          'AV-negative' => 1,
          'size' => 43321,
          'directionality' => 'Incoming',
          'Message-ID' => '\'<20060224000554.GA86083@domain.com>\'',
          'subject' => '\'TEST subject here\'',
          'PRSA' => 'DEFAULT in the inbound table',
          'AS' => {
                      'CASE' => 'negative'
          },
          'ICID' => 63,
          'SBRS' => 'None',
          'sendergroup' => 'None',
          'policy' => 'ACCEPT',
          'rcpt_count' => 1,
          'rcpts' => {
                       '0' => {
                                'resolution' => 'delivered',
                                'rcpt_name' => 'user@domain.com'
                                'deliverytime' => 'Tue May  8 11:00:31 2007'
                              }
                     },
          'aliases' => {
                    'user@domain.com' => '[\'user@domain.com\']'
           },
          'Brightmail-positive' => 1,
          'from' => 'foo@bar.com',
          'delivered_rcpts' => 1,
          'MID' => 71,
          'camefrom_MID' => 69,
          'Delivery status' => 'from rewritten'
        };

Questions:
Why can I find more hits for "Brightmail positive" in the logs than are
shown by the output of this program?
  Matches which are of messages injected on a connection which was established
  prior to the first log file processed are ignored.  The first step in the
  parsing is to see the connection establishment, so without that the connected
  MIDs and results are ignored.

What is meant by 'Unknown' here?
    Messages
      received on Unknown (old conn) 12,063
  Answer: For any messages injected on connections logged prior to the
  first log file given for parsing, the message can only be categorized as
  having been injected on an 'Unknown' interface.

Why doesn't my 'HAT actions' section have much information?
  The most likely answer is: your IronPort MGA is running a version of AsyncOS
  older than 4.5.0, and you do not have the verbose logging entry turned on.

How many log files can I have this program process?
  This will somewhat depend on the system you run the program on.  It has been
  used with great success to process as much as 50GB of logs at a shot.
  Other factors in the processing are things like workqueue backup.  Since
  the processing is mostly all done in-memory until the result is returned,
  program memory utilisation can become quite high when the log files indicate
  a workqueue backup on the MGA - this is because the built-up message
  objects are not removed from memory until an event is seen indicating the
  message completion.
  On a reasonably fast system such as a Dell 2850, a 100MB mail log file should
  take about 40 seconds or less to process.  (no -collate or -per flags)
  

What are the most useful outputs of this program?
  That will depend entirely on what type of information you're looking for.
  Some of the most interesting portions of the standard report are the
  Sizes and SBRS tables.  For import into a spreadsheet, the file given
  by use of -minutes/-hourly/-daily is also quite valuable.

What are the recommended ways to use the program?
  Please see the 'Usages' section at the top of this file.
