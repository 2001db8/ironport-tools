.427 - Fixed significant problem in data output for msg-* flags
     - Fixed period graph output count of AV-positives
.426 - Fixes to data output by msg-csv and msg-project
     - do not report domains at all if the sender address didn't have a '@'
.425 - Fixes to data output by msg-csv and msg-project
.424 - Minor fix to help
     - integrate specialized output flag -etisoutput for Belgacom
     - some fixes around use of 'mydomain' and/or the 'domains' file
     - fix -per_domain collation to use full domain, not 'whatdomain' chop
     - added -debugmid for easier debugging of specific MIDs
.423 - Some updates/changes to support PPeterson's project (msg-csv)
     - better collation of TLS in/out overall statistics for MMartinek
     - bytes-counting for per_domain for MTurner's Pepsico deal
     - per_domain and per_rcpt output now shows rcpts in and rcpts out columns.
       Messages column became rcpts in, which is what it actually is.
.422 - Gather some statistics on PRSA spam/virus rates
.421 - HTML output includes daily and hourly time graphs
     - expand size-areas collated to include 10-20MB and 20-30MB
     - further cleanup/changes to support -msg-project
.420 - added -savestate to attempt to save and load stateful information.
       The entry takes a directory parameter where the stateful files will
       be kept and updated.  Results may be unpredictable at this point.
     - changed tracemail functionality to use same code as msg-csv, and output
       function stolen from searchhier.pl
.419 - added -syslog to attempt to read IronPort mail logs that were recorded
       via syslog
     - added -interim to indicate interest in showing full interim engine
       statistics rather than just the 'Anti-Spam' or 'Anti-Virus' sections.
       Default is to not show those.
     - added Message-ID to msg-csv output
     - -hourly and -daily are forced on by use of -htmloutput, will be used
       more in a future version.  The filenames are linkified in the output
     - Fixed the Workqueue max column in the time periods output.
     - Added some counters from Status log entries 
     - Removed the parsing for the old stubby SBRS log entry
     - Drastically revamped the code for -hourly -daily -minutes collation
     - expanded SBRS regex and bar chart range to include 10 and -10 which are
       now showing up as values from senderbase lookups
     - catch BV tagged, not just rejected, log entries
.418 - Try a buffer-deletes scheme to see if that provides performance benefit
     - Allow for complete suppression of both txt and html stat final
       computation and output via -nostats
     - -collate-ldap-rejects is now just -collate-rejects and it does RAT as
       well as LDAPACCEPT collation.
     - splintered messages now count towards stats as real messages.  This
       provides a better view of what the processing level actually is, though
       it may differ significantly from what the system is actually *receiving*
.417 - Support different AV engine output stats based on 'interim verdicts'
       for 5.1.0 alpha
     - statistic output of Anti-Virus and Anti-Spam sections changed.  Specific
       sections (CASE/Brightmail/Sophos/McAfee) are present, rolling up into a
       general Anti-Virus or Anti-Spam section
     - Interim AV and AS sections are now shown
.416 - msg-csv includes sendergroup column
     - rcpt and resolution column moved further to the right
     - Due to possible odd values in rcpt and sender fields, those fields are
       now double-quoted
     - msg-csv flag must be given as a filename (previously autogenerated)
     - added overwrite-msg-csv flag so that if desired a same-name msg-csv file
       given can be overwritten instead of appended to. Default to 0 (off)
       means that BY DEFAULT an existing CSV file of the same name will be
       appended to.
     - added -msg-csv-cachesize flag to control csv write-out buffer size (lines)
       Default to 5000 entries
     - lock each log file as it is being read to prevent multiple processes from
       reading the same file.  Lockfile name is <file>.sptw_locked
     - added -skip-processed flag. This causes a file listing previously
       processed files to be kept in the same directory as the log files.
       The file name is '.sptw_processed'
     - This is the earliest version necessary to support use of hiermove.pl and 
       the associated searchhier.pl
     - Lots of much better per-rcpt resolution tracking, most specifically for
       msg-csv purposes.  May later limit this collation unless -msg-csv in use
     - Break out specific TLS info in sections 'TLS in' and 'TLS out'
.414 - ignore 'Could not convert character set' entries
     - fix behaviour for LDAPACCEPT drop/bounce in the workqueue
     - make improvements around graph representation of LDAPACCEPT behaviours
     - make -collate-limit apply to per_domain and per_rcpt counts
     - make -collate-limit default to 100
     - Clean and LDAP-rej counts are per-rcpt, not per-msg, derived now - this
       makes a difference only for the purpose of the graphs shown.
.413 - HAT reject pie slice set to 1 per reject by default.  To use extrapolation
       set to 0 at runtime
     - fix to not barf on ISQ digest notification Start MID lines
     - handle "Message size exceeds limit" line new in 5.0.0
.412 - Enable an extrapolated "Rejectable" pie slice when a SG BLACKLIST is
       associated with areject policy
     - Add numbers into the tooltips
     - Cause HAT reject pie slice to be a calculated product based upon the
       runtime-derived avg number of recipients per connection
.411 - if -collate-ip is given twice (full IPs collated), a section of up to
        100 entries is created: 'DNS switches'
     - count max concurrency and WQ buildup per min/hour/day for those outputs
     - more fix up for 5.0.0
.410 - SBRS graph of percent-spam per score level first rev, usable
.409 - output 10 'Costliness' lines, more columnar format
     - add some more graphs to the HTML output
     - add a basic bandwidth-saved calculation

.408 - make counting for Bounce Verification better
     - fix a problem with collation in -collate-from with splintering
     - begin changing #ASpos items in output to show %ASpos instead
     - include an avg byte count in -collate-from and -collate-domain. Requested
       by L3
     - all output which used to say #ASpos has been converted to a percentage of
       Msgs in shown
     - added -bouncedetail to collate addresses which bounced
.407 - make detected IncomingRelay stuff fix up connection and per-message SBRS
       counts
     - patch parsing to handle TLS log entry bug 25546
     - add capability to specify logo for inclusion in the HTML output: -logofile
     - add capability to limit data collation reported in -collate*: -collate-limit
     - add collated chart data for -timings similar to the sizes data
.406 - preliminary support for Bounce Verification (4.7.0) log entries
     - make use of -t1 and -t2 much faster in many-file use cases
     - add some support for db use via -sql: only connection logging atm
     - some basic HTML formatted output and a single pie-chart via -htmloutput
     - add -collate-ldap-rejects
.405 - fix a variable usage problem with -collate-domain and -collate-from
     - make -collate-ip say that it's doing collation on Class C, when it does that
     - new column for both -collate-from and -collate-domain: #ASpos
.404 - show a percentage spam positive on just the AS-positive line
     - begin changing what -mydomain and the domains file do; they're currently
       unused afaik
     - attempt to fix more situations in which errors are given because I lost
       track of something rewritten, footerstamped, and BCC'd
.403 - add a bit more sanity checking, error output IRT running on an MGA
     - merge ICID section into 'Connections in'
     - merge DCID section into 'Connections out (delivery)'
     - place 'Connection Errors' under 'Connections out (delivery)'
     - place 'Possible delivery' under 'Connections out (delivery)'
     - calculate rcpts per connection for both successful and otherwise
     - some consolidation in memory object cleanup
     - abbreviated 'Costliness' output
     - Show only full integer SBRS.  Old style with decimal granularity can be
       acheived via use of the -all-sbrs flag.
.402 - fixed a problem with msg-csv rcpt completion information
.401 - Some fixes to logic around ignoring log entries for which the ICID init
       was not seen some problems here can cause premature bailout
.400 - add -minutes corrolary to -hourly, -daily
     - use of the source can now work on a 4.5.0+ version of the MGA
     - output.pl now uses mostly printf formatted output
     - -collate-ip now has a 'max concurrency' column, per IP shown
     - -collate-from and -collate-domain have more data columns
     - -seat-count added, attempts to count number of individual users for each
        major feature
     - added Sizes statistics for AV, AS sections
     - stop counting parts of messages injected by connections established in a
       previous log file
     - stop collating various stats on the basis of bounce messages generated
       on-system.
       This and the above will make stats look slightly different for the version,
       as compared to version .397 run against the same logs.
     - streamline some collation processes for SBRS info
     - abbreviated and hopefully made clearer some of the AV and AS section outputs
     - some extra stuff for a DK statistics project via use of -msg-csv
.397 - beginnings of support for 4.6.0 logs
     - -collate-ip now uses ClassC by default
     - -collate-ip now has a Max Concurrency [reached] column
     - more useful Sizes statistics section
.396 - fixed spam detection stat cases for use of CASE engine
